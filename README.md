**NOTE**

**Please run JUnit tests before committing**, or at least tag the commit as `broken`.

Jenkins would be cool, but it costs $, and I don't feel like running a server out of my bedroom.

If you want to fork, feel free. But don't change money for this application. It is private, but should stay free.
